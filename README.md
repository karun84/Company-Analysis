# Company-Analysis
Comprehensive employee data analysis, exploring team distribution, salary expenditure, and age demographics. Includes data cleaning, visualizations, and key business insights using Python and Matplotlib.

1. Initial Steps
 I started by checking foir any duplicates existing in the dataset.
 After which I corrected the "Height" coloumn using random() to create values ranging from 150-180 on the missing tables.
 Furthermore I replaced the missing values in the "Salary" coloumn with the mean of the rest of the data from the same coloumn.

2. Analysing

    Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
    Found that the distribution of workers by percentage is more or less the same.
